# AI + VC Path

# 👋 Hi there  

Hi, I’m **Partho** 👋
I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science (Management) at the University of Queensland, with the long-term goal of becoming a venture capitalist and someone who backs ambitious founders building meaningful companies.

This repository is my open journal: a place to share what I’ve learned so far, where I’m headed and the small experiments along the way. It’s not just about AI (though I’m diving deep there), I’m equally curious about startups, strategy and investing across different industries.

## 🌱 Why am I doing this?  
Because most journeys are only visible when people “arrive or succeed”. I don’t want to wait until then.  
This is a space for the unpolished middle, experiments, mistakes, reflection, and all the kind of stuff you usually don’t see but actually matters the most.

## 📂 What’s in this repo?  
This repo is more like a logbook than a showcase. If you go through it, you’ll get:  
- Snapshots of what I’m learning and trying out  
- Notes and reflections on startups, markets, and ideas  
- My thought process as I move through different phases of growth  

It’s less about polished outcomes, more about progress in motion.
